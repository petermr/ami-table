# ami-table
Tools to extract tables from PDF and other documents. Used in conjunction with the `svg2xml` repo
at https://bitbucket.org/petermr/svg2xml/wiki/Home 

Initially created to support the ContentMine-UCL project, but everyone is welcome. 

## extracted tables
Examples of extracted tables are in the `table/html` and `table/marked` directories. Some of these are "perfectly"
extracted, others are unextracted. Extraction depends on customising the heuristics and parameters within svg2xml.
